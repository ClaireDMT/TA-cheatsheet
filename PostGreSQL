# PostgreSQL

## Error to connect to the DB

### Error message: "pg connectionbad could not connect to server no such file or directory"

### Solution
Some old PID (process id) file to remove. 
Your computer didn't complete the shutdown process completely which means postgres didn't delete the PID (process id) file.
