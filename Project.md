## DAY 1

### GOALS

1. Write user stories down. You should have no more than 15. We recommend setting up a Trello board to coordinate tasks between team members
    [user stories sheet](https://github.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/raw/master/rails/rails-user-stories.pdf)

2. Open db.lewagon.com and figure out the database schema
3. Draw mock-ups of every screen your app needs. Draw arrows between them to show how your user will move between them. 
   This will help give you to the unique value proposition of your app.
4.From the mock-ups, figure out the routes

#### When it is done 

1. `Rails new` with the devise [template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates#devise)
